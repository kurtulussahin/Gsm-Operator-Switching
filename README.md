# GSM Operator Switching Model

The model was designed to analyze switching behavior of customers
in the GSM sector through the Agent Based Modeling approach.

The model in this project helps to understand switching process
between three operators.

### Modeling The Environment

**Number Of Customers:** 10.000

**Number Of Operators:** 3

**Time Period:** 36 month

**Repetition:** 100 times


Switchin decision based on utilities customer gained from operators.

Customers face to face to decide the best operator for themselves at the end of each month and
according to the calculations in switching decision of customers that focuses on the utilities customer gain
from each operator based on specific criteria and general values namely brand image and price policies. Due
to the fact that all factors that affect the switching behavior cannot be embodied in the model so that the
results could be interpreted in reliability, all unpredicted effect are included in the model by adding
probability to the model.

### Identifying GSM Companies
